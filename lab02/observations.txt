example1:
some of the code thats shown goes wiht the input of start and some goes with stop input.
If it doesnt match any of the input it will just echo it

example2:
When I typed 1234 it outputs NUMBER and when I typed just word or name John it outputs WORD
If I include underscore as my input it adds the underscore before any of both output as _NUMBER or _WORD.
or when I typed underscore between the words it outputed WORD _WORD as it gets the WORD and outputs the underscore and then WORD
WHen only inputed underscore it just outputs underscore
After putting it in the identifier it works as one of the other kinds for when added to WORD when added to both it will just output NUMBER for underscore

example4:
terminal: it is already prefdefined.
non-terminal: they are symbols that has to be defined by you 

WHen ran the program it doesn't really tell us as top above showed 
heat on
        Heater on!
heat off
        Heater off!
set temperature 22
        New temperature set!

rather showed heat turned on or off and Temperature set
heat on
        Heater on!
heat off
        Heater off!
set temperature 22
        New temperature set!

example5:
Now it does tell it is turned on and off and it specifies which temperature it got set to
